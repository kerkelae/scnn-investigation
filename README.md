# sCNN Investigation

This repository contains the code (not data) for the following paper:

- Kerkel√§ L, Seunarine K, Szczepankiewicz F and Clark CA (2024) _Spherical convolutional neural networks can improve brain microstructure estimation from diffusion MRI data._ Front. Neuroimaging 3:1349415. doi: [10.3389/fnimg.2024.1349415](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnimg.2024.1349415)

The sCNN implementation can be found in the `scnn` package. I used the Conda environment `environment/scnn.yml` to run the code except that `environment/dmipy.yml` was used for conventional fitting.
