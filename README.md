# sCNN Investigation

This repository contains the code (not data) accompanying my manuscript _"Applying spherical convolutional neural networks to estimate brain microstructure from diffusion MRI data"_. If you find this work beneficial in work that leads to a scientific publication, please consider citing the arXiv preprint. The sCNN implementation can be found in the `scnn` package. I used the Conda environment `environment/scnn.yml` to run the code except that `environment/dmipy.yml` was used for conventional fitting.
